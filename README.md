Hereâ€™s a comprehensive README.md template for your spam analysis project. This file will serve as a guide for anyone reviewing your project, explaining what it does, how it works, and how to use it.
Spam Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview

This project is a machine learning-based approach to detecting spam messages. The dataset used for this analysis consists of SMS messages labeled as either ham (legitimate) or spam (unwanted messages). The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately distinguish between ham and spam messages based on their content.
Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is spam (1).csv, which contains the following columns:

    text: The content of the SMS messages.
    Class: The label indicating whether the message is ham or spam.

Dataset Source

    This dataset is a well-known SMS spam dataset available in many text mining repositories.

Project Steps

    Text Preprocessing:
        Lowercasing the text to maintain uniformity.
        Removing punctuation and special characters.
        Removing stop words to eliminate common but non-informative words.
        Tokenizing and stemming words to reduce them to their root form.

    Feature Extraction:
        Applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the preprocessed text into numerical features for the model to interpret.

    Handling Imbalance:
        Addressed the class imbalance issue using oversampling techniques, such as RandomOverSampler, to ensure balanced training data.

    Model Training:
        Trained a Logistic Regression model on the balanced dataset.
        Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluated the model's performance using confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, and ROC-AUC curve.
        Generated word clouds for both spam and ham messages to visualize the common terms used in each class.

Results

    Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 97.6%.
    Confusion Matrix:
        True Negatives (Ham classified as Ham): 1431
        False Positives (Ham classified as Spam): 17
        True Positives (Spam classified as Spam): 201
        False Negatives (Spam classified as Ham): 23
    Precision-Recall Curve: Demonstrates a good balance between precision and recall.
    ROC-AUC Score: AUC = 0.99, indicating excellent model performance.

Visualizations

    Confusion Matrix: Displays the correct and incorrect classifications.
    Precision-Recall Curve: Shows the trade-off between precision and recall.
    ROC Curve: Illustrates the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
    Word Clouds: Visual representation of the most frequent words in spam and ham messages.
